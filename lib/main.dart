// 💡 What is a StatefulWidget/StatelessWidget?
  // StatelessWidget
  // Does not change after it’s built.
  // Example: A Text("Hello") — once it shows “Hello”, it always shows “Hello”.

  // StatefulWidget
  // Can change over time (it has state that can be updated).
  // Example: A counter that increases when you press a button.

// 💡Root of the App
void main() {
  // _logger.d("Debugging");
